# üêç Python Tutorial

## üßê Setup!

Python is a really popular language, and it's named after Monty Python, so you know it's gotta be good. First, let's make sure you have it on your dang computer. 

In your terminal, type `python --version` and hit enter. 

If you get an error, you don't have python at all. If not, it will list your Python version. If your version is under 3.6, try entering `python3 --version`. If you have at least version 3.6, you're all set! If not, you'll need to install Python.

### Installing Python3 - Windows 

Go to [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download 3.7.3.

### Installing Python3 - Mac

Macs come with Python on them, but you might not have the newest version. You can install it with Homebrew. If you don't already have Homebrew, you can install it with this ruby command:
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

And then install the newest Python like so:

```
brew install python3
```

### Setting Up Our File

Let's start with a basic Python script. Create a new directory, cd into it, create and open new file, and name it `main.py`. In that file, write this:

```
print("Hello world!")
```

To run that file, run `python3 main.py` in your command line.
